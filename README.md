Loan Eligibility Prediction 🚀

📚 Overview
This project predicts loan eligibility based on applicant details using supervised machine learning models. The goal is to help financial institutions make faster, data-driven decisions by analyzing applicants' demographic and financial information.


📊 Problem Statement
Financial institutions receive hundreds of loan applications daily. Approving or rejecting loans manually is time-consuming and prone to bias. This project automates the eligibility decision using predictive modeling.



✅ Key Features
Data preprocessing and cleaning
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature engineering and encoding
Model training using supervised learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)
Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
Final prediction on test data

✅ Conclusion
The model successfully predicts loan eligibility with good accuracy and can be further improved by hyperparameter tuning or using ensemble methods.


✨ Future Enhancements
Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearch or RandomizedSearch
Model deployment using Flask or Streamlit
